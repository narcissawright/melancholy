# User Interface 

Many of the images are currently not the same resolution as they are displayed in-game.
Godot's filtering is pretty good, so they look okay, but it's certainly using much more data than necessary.
A future improvement would be to optimize all images for 1920x1080 (my target resolution).

For other resolutions, if that ever becomes a priority, images of appropriate size can be created from the raw assets (.kra files).
