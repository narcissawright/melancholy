Melanie - walks, sprints, has the shield pushback mechanic
Melancholy - coasts across the ground via magic, "jumping" like carrie is faster than running.

melancholy - sine movement, 0f jumpsquat if already running (3f if grounded), tap A to airjump @ ledgegrab height


field of falling stars is the "menu" world
- unlock stuff here as you progress in the game

unlockables:
- time of day changer (for time trials)
- various items or upgrades (etc)
- is just a playground for moving around etc
- peaceful music, a safe area
- maybe as you approach the boundary (bottom of the hill far away from center) its like that guitar song lvl from mario odyssey with the semi transparent border going up

you should spawn from a falling star andi t should happen rather quickly

at first one of the only places should be the "full game" area

eventually unlock wardrobe, eventually unlock melancholy
separate time trials for each character

for actual levels try to keep a bit of "arcade scenario" -- gameplay design focused levels, but not too arcadey.
a good length too.

melancholy-- magic meter is added. maybe vials that can fill up and if you run out of magic they break.
5 levels of powerup for both characters instead of 3
melanie should get bombs as a subweapon, ahve melanie use classic subweapon stuff while melancholy uses magic and is different
melancholy should have low max hp



Subweapons - Melanie:
- Bomb (fast pull, can throw them far, large hitbox, can throw to targeted enemy too)
- Holy Water (cannot throw far, massive damage with innermost hitbox...)
- Bow & Arrow (1stish person aiming, 3rdish person with targetting on)
- ?? (did I have an idea for this?)

Melanie has to pick up the subwep ammo.

Spells - Melancholy
- Airwalker (hover boots but can use as long as you have magic. can jump from airwalk)
- Beam (high damage draining laser, aimable)
- Tree (indicator as to where it will spawn, like a slow holy water that does ridic damage and knockback)
- Lightning (damage all nearby enemies. if none are around, you get struck instead.)

Melancholy can absorb the subwep ammo from a distance (as mana) using her shield
Melancholy has 1/4th HP, but a new magic meter as long as the original HP bar.

Shop could sell items for subwep ammo?
- Power Ups
- Subweapon
- Key
- Time Change
- Maybe status cure if that exists

Gimmick! (NES) had a score system that accounted for all drops. I want to use a system like this to avoid RNG.
Only issue is if it is hidden, then it becomes very difficult to "resync" yourself. so it would have to be shown somehow...
